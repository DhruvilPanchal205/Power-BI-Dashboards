# Accenture North America Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project showcases the data analytics process used during my Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage. The core operations involved include **data cleaning**, **data modeling**, and **data visualization** using **Power BI**.

## Objectives
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to:
- Clean and prepare raw data for analysis.
- Create data models that help in deriving meaningful insights.
- Visualize key metrics through dashboards in Power BI.

## Key Operations
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing or incorrect values.
- Standardized and formatted the data for efficient analysis.
- Removed duplicates and inconsistencies to maintain data quality.

### 2. Data Modeling
- Created relationships between various tables.
- Developed data structures that allowed for advanced data analysis.
- Ensured model scalability and performance.

### 3. Data Visualization (Power BI)
- Built interactive dashboards to visualize critical business metrics.
- Utilized features such as slicers, filters, and drill-through for deep data insights.
- Provided actionable insights to help drive business decisions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: For building data models and creating visualizations.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For initial data cleaning operations.
- **Forage Platform**: This job simulation was completed on Forage, providing a real-world scenario for data analytics.
