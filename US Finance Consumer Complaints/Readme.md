# US Consumer Finance Complaints Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze consumer complaints in the U.S. finance sector, providing insights into trends, categories, and resolutions of complaints. The analysis is conducted using Power BI for data visualization and Excel for initial data processing.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze consumer complaints in the finance sector.
- Identify key trends and patterns in complaint data.
- Provide actionable insights for stakeholders to improve customer satisfaction.

## Data Collection

The primary data source for this project is the [Kaggle Consumer Finance Complaints Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), which includes data on consumer complaints submitted against financial institutions. The dataset contains information such as:

- **Complaint ID**: Unique identifier for each complaint.
- **Product**: The financial product associated with the complaint.
- **Issue**: The nature of the complaint.
- **Consumer’s State**: The state where the consumer resides.
- **Submission Date**: The date the complaint was submitted.
- **Company Response**: The company's response to the complaint.

## Data Operations

I performed **6 key data operations** as part of this analysis:

1. **Defining Objectives**:
   - Outlined the goals of the analysis, focusing on understanding the nature of complaints and identifying trends based on categories and demographics.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries, handled missing values, and standardized data formats.

3. **Data Integration**:
   - Combined multiple data sources where necessary to ensure a comprehensive dataset.

4. **Data Transformation**:
   - Converted categorical variables into numerical formats and created derived metrics such as complaint resolution rates.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted preliminary analyses using Excel to visualize data distributions and identify trends.

6. **Feature Selection/Engineering**:
   - Selected relevant features for analysis and created new features, such as complaint duration.

## Dashboard Showcase

The final dashboard created in Power BI includes:

- **Key Metrics**: Total complaints, resolution rate, and average response time.
